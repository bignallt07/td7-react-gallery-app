# Notes for Reviewer
1. I am aiming for Exceeds, however I will accept Meets. 
2. I believe that I have figured out the loading indicator, however I seem to be getting inconsistant results and don't understand why. If I have done this incorrectly, could you advise on why?
3. Please see the CSS changes note (3 sections up)
